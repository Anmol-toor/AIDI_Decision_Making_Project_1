The Data Science Process Lifecycle for analyzing the Red Wine Quality Dataset starts with defining the goal of understanding the main factors that affect wine quality. Then, the dataset, which contains various measurements and quality scores, is gathered and cleaned up to ensure it's ready for analysis. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to explore the data's patterns and relationships. After that, new features may be created to improve how well the model works. Next, machine learning models are built to predict wine quality, and their effectiveness is measured using appropriate evaluation methods. Once a suitable model is found, it can be put to practical use. Ongoing monitoring ensures the model stays accurate over time, and the insights gained are shared with stakeholders to help them make informed decisions.
